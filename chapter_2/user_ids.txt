To allow certain users to change certain parts of a file:

This is useful if a user can only edit a portion of a file. the command "chsh" uses this to change the login shell for a specific user, but it needs to edit /etc/passwd. We need to make sure that only certain users can edit certain portions of the /etc/passwd

-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 40432 Mar 29  2016 /usr/bin/chsh
chsh has the "s" flag turned on, which is the setuid flag. 

chmod u+s {binary} 
Allow different users to run programs as root, so that a file that the program modifies can be written even though the user running the program doesn't have the privelages for it.

Only works if the binary is owned by root

If you don't have setuid set, if the program runs something the user doesn't have privelages to, the program returns an error 

getuid() and geteuid():
getuid(): print out the id of the user running the program
geteuid(): print out the user that effectively carries the permissions to do stuff.
