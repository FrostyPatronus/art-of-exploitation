EXAMINE gdb

x/<number of items to examine>{o,x,u,t}{b,h,w,g}

Number of items to examine: 
n * {b,h,w,g}
If n = 2 and you chose to output it in word, you will get
2 * 32 bits of data = 64 bits of data = 16 hex digits. Lets us examine
multiple units after the target address 

Controls how the data is formatted
o = Octet
x = Hexadecimal
u = Unsigned integer
t = Binary

Controls how long each data "packet" is.
b = byte (2 hex digits)     (8 bits )
h = halfword (4 hex digits) (16 bits)
w = word (8 hex digits)     (32 bits)
g = giant (16 hex digits)   (64 bits)

(gdb) x/2xb $rip
0x40052e <main+8>:  0xc7    0x45
(gdb) x/2ub $rip
0x40052e <main+8>:  199 69

(gdb) x/1xh $rip
0x40052e <main+8>:  0x45c7
(gdb) x/1uh $rip
0x40052e <main+8>:  17863

Î» bc -ql
(256^1)*199 + (256^0)*69
51013
(256^1)*69 + (256^0)*199
17863

0xc7 is equal to 199, and 0x45 is equal to 69
If I change the base in the anti-little-endian order, I will get a 
wrong answer compared to the x/1uh (51013, which is wrong). However, if
I interpret it in the correct order, I get 17863, which is 0x45c7

The base change formula is 256 because there are 256 combinations in 
a single byte (which is 8 bits, which is 2^8 = 256)
