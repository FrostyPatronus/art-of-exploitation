EXAMINE gdb

x/<number of items to examine>{o,x,u,t}{b,h,w,g}

Number of items to examine: 
n * {b,h,w,g}
If n = 2 and you chose to output it in word, you will get
2 * 32 bits of data = 64 bits of data = 16 hex digits. Lets us examine
multiple units after the target address 

Controls how the data is formatted
o = Octet
x = Hexadecimal
u = Unsigned integer
t = Binary

Controls how long each data "packet" is.
b = byte (2 hex digits)     (8 bits )
h = halfword (4 hex digits) (16 bits)
w = word (8 hex digits)     (32 bits)
g = giant (16 hex digits)   (64 bits)
