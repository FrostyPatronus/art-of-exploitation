char str_a[20];
str_a[0] = 'W';
...
...

BUT strcpy(str_a, "Hello, World") does that all for you

if somewhere, maybe
str_a[5] = 0;
then printf will only print until that point. Called a null byte

strcpy(destination, source) will stop copying the literal to the 
variable if it encounters a null byte
