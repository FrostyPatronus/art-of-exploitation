Local Variables live in igher addresses than global and static variables

Five memory segments:

TEXT - All the code is in this part
EIP: 
1. Read instruction in the EIP register
2. Add length of current instruction to the EIP register
3. Execute instruction read in step 1
4. Go back to step one 

You cannot write on this block. If you do, the program will die.
Being write-only allows other programs to share the execution of the
program

Fixed size

DATA - Initialized global and static variables
Also has fixed size.

BSS - UNINITIALIZED global and static variables. Fixed size.

HEAP - could directly access this memory. Variable size
malloc and free. User can reserve or deallocate memory in heap. Goes towards higher memory addresses.

STACK - where all the stackframes live. Functions and local variables have. Goes towards lower memory addresses.

Heap and Stack goes opposite ways.
