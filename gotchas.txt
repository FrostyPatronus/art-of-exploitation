Use %p to display pointers
use %x to display hexadecimals

%n accepts an integer pointer to an int variable. It will write the number of bytes printf has written until that part.

Pointer types only determine pointer arithmetic
(Char pointers when added by one will increase by one) 
(Int pointers when added by one will increase by four)

Segmentation Fault is when you try to access memory that is not there 

you can only initialize a static variable once

local variables have higher addresses than global and static variables
